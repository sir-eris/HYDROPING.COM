HydroPing is powered by Shopify, which enables us to provide the Services to you.
The below terms and conditions, together with any policies referenced herein (these “Terms of Service” or “Terms”) describe your rights and responsibilities when you use the Services.
Please read these Terms of Service carefully, as they include important information about your legal rights and cover areas such as warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability.

We do not warrant that the appearance or quality of any products or services purchased by you will meet your expectations or be the same as depicted or rendered in our online stores.
All descriptions of products are subject to change at any time without notice at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time and may limit the quantities of any products that we offer to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction, on a case-by-case basis.

You will cooperate in the defense of indemnified claims, including by providing relevant documents.
